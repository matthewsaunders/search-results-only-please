# Search Results Only Please

A google chrome extension to remove ads from google, bing, and duckduckgo search results.

## Background

Have you ever noticed that modern search results require you to scroll past a full screen of ads to hit the first real search result?

Things have gotten out of hand! Luckily, using this extension, we can ask politely for the __Search Results Only Please__! And just like that, there are no more ads cluttering your search results.
